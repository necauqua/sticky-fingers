## Sticky fingers

A simple (on the surface lmao) challenge mod for Noita.

Your keys are all sticky step-bro!
Whenever you press a key or a mouse button, it will be held down until you
press it again.

That's it.

## Installation

Copy the `sticky-fingers` folder into your `mods` directory.
You can download the zip of this repository from GitHub to do so.

## Compatibility
This should work will all Noita versions present and future, as well as on both
Steam and GOG versions of the game.
If it does not, please open an issue.

## License
This mod, like everything I did ever, is licensed under the MIT license.
This means that if you use significant parts (especially the contents of the
`files/` folder heh) of this you need to include the LICENCE file in your
distribution - which has my name on top of it.

Or just credit me lol.
